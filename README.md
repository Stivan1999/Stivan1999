<h1>Hi, I'm Youssef! <br/></h1>
I have a background in Electrical and Software Engineering. I have been exploring the cloud and building my skills doing hands-on
projects on AWS. I am also improving my documentation skills by writing about the projects I am doing.

<br>I love learning more about technology and how it works behind the scenes. I also enjoy explaining tecnical concepts
to others. My ideal role would invlove working more with people, understanding their needs, translating those needs into technical solutions, 
and helping them solve technical problems in the cloud.
