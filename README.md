<h2>About Me</h2>

<h2>About Me</h2>

Hi, I'm Youssef — a technologist with a background in Electrical Engineering and three years of experience as a software engineer in the agriculture industry. I'm passionate about learning how technology works, and I'm especially drawn to the intersection of AI, automation, and strategic problem solving.

I’m currently focused on learning AI by completing courses and  building real-world projects that apply cutting-edge tools like ChatGPT, Hugging Face, and agent-based workflow automation frameworks. My goal is to use AI to design intelligent, human-centered solutions that solve real business problems.

While I have a strong foundation in software development, I thrive most in roles that involve big-picture thinking, system design, collaboration, and translating technical tools into meaningful outcomes. I'm actively building a portfolio to demonstrate my AI capabilities and prepare for roles at the intersection of AI, product strategy, and responsible technology leadership.
