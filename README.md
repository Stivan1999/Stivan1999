<h2>About Me</h2>
I am an engineer with 3.5 years of experience transitioning into the world of AI Automation.

My background in technical engineering has disciplined me in systematic problem solving and process optimization. Now, I am applying that rigor to business operations.

My goal is to leverage AI tools to automate workflows, generate content, and integrate intelligent systems into finance and operations, moving away from isolated coding tasks towards high-impact business integration.
